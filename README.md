Predictive algorithm for equities. Prepared after taking a quantitative finance cource with Societe FInanciers educational group.

The project has 3 main building blocks: Equity.py, LIB_SFQ_Vanilla_MC_Fns.py and RunAlgorithm.py

Equity.py- deals with all of the operations held inside "Stock" class
LIB_SFQ_Vanilla_MC_Fns.py- librarycontainer which handles most of the getters and setters functions, in addition to the main Monte-Carlo logic functions
RunAlgorithm.py- the executable piece

The results can be seen as follows on the picture
